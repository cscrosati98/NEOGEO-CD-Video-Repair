All voltages seem fine except pin 10.<br>

Pin 10, Sync in is supposed to be around 2.2V, but is coming in at double the amount. ~4.4V. This may be the issue causing the jailbars. I would need to find the capacitor and resistor used for this pin to check for possible damage. R45 C13 On SNK LSPC2-A2 Pin 150 is Sync Pin 170 is 24MHz Clock input Pin 101 is 4MHz clock
